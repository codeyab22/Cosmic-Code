# Cosmic-Code
This is my fourth project. This project is making a quiz and setting my timer. If you get the correct answer, the timer runs on it own. If it is incorrect, then the seconds of the timer is deducted.  I am defining my variables, creating functions, using methods to make sure that the timer works properly. 

Motivation(S):
My motivation is to make sure that everything is in order with logic and accurate. Another motivation is to have enjoyable time with coding . Making the buttons work, you have to create a start button function and add the eventlistener.

I would like to build my project to increase mobility and my thinking process.
