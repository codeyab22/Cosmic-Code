# Cosmic-Code
This is my fourth project. This project is making a quiz and setting my timer. If you get the correct answer, the timer runs on it own. If it is incorrect, then the seconds of the timer is deducted.  I am defining my variables, creating functions, using methods to make sure that the buttons and the timer works properly. This is the activity that we previously went over and building  the timer together will give. 

# User's Story

There is an person like me to want to mess around the computer. Quizzing myself to know  how good I am of remembering code. This is the quiz that challenge you  to questions. 

# Motivation(S):
My motivation is to make sure that everything is in order with logic and accurate. Another motivation is to have enjoyable time with coding and taking steps to solve the challenges on my own. Making the buttons work, you have to create a start button function and add the eventlistener. 

I would like to build my project to increase mobility and speed for this process. Also, I would build my working with function skills.
